Axion-The Search Continues! is an online publication with a unique perspective of minimal educational content, using the flat design style. It discusses on scientific, technological, political, philosophical and psychological subjects and focuses on large global problems.

We research and draft to make you aware of the current progression of the World! . Rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look for resources in the internet for reliable information from the relevant source.

Axion-The Search Continues! is based on the works of others all collected at one place.
The goal of our work is to make use of knowledge that is locked away in books and achieve the progress we are capable of. To flow towards a better future, we need to understand how and why the world is changing.
We take a broad perspective, covering an extensive range of aspects. Covering all of these aspects in one resource makes it possible to understand how global-trends are interlinked. We explain even the complex topics on a witty way. We create simple 2D-illustrations for editorial purpose.
We make our publishes by following steps:
	• First we make a list of topics to focus on beforehand
	• Then is preparing the script which is based on complete research from different resources such as books, scientific papers, journals, consulting experts
	• Then we prepare a general rough draft which goes through continuous editing
	• Then comes the attraction; the illustrations and animations(if required)
We also add some music and sound for some animations which is optional
